Added:
* Ability to configure settings independently for app and for each of one or more widgets.
* Ability to select a different time zone for each widget.
* Selectable widget layouts enabling addition of a time zone label above or below the time display.

Changed:
* Internal details related to updating of widgets' time and features, to improve efficiency.

Removed:
* The back arrow from the title bar of each Settings screen, since the arrow performs the same function as the Save button,

Fixed:
* Issues with widget time display text size being incorrect for the width of the widget (3 or >=4 tiles wide).

NOTE: Installing this update will likely require resetting settings for any widgets currently in use.
