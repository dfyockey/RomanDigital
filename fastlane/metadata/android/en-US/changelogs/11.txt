Changed:
* The screen area into which the color sliders can be scrolled, thereby reducing the amount of scrolling needed to access all of the sliders.

Fixed:
* The following, primarily caused by a user's increase of font size in Android's system settings:
  * Misalignment of the color code label '#' in the Time Color dialog
  * The Time Color dialog's preview text being too large for proper display
