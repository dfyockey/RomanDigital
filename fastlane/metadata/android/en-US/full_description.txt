The RomanDigital app provides a clock of unique style that can be used to repurpose an old device or to display time on a current model.

For more personal use, the RomanDigital widget makes a distinctive addition to a device's Home screen.

RomanDigital includes features expected in an ordinary digital clock app, such as:
<ul>
<li>Choice of 12 or 24 hour format</li>
<li>Optional AM/PM indicator (uniquely integrated into the time display)</li>
<li>Option to keep display on when app is in the foreground</li>
<li>Display in either portrait or landscape</li>
</ul>

For more detailed information, please see the README.md file accompanying the RomanDigital source code.
