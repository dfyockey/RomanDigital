The RomanDigital app provides a clock of unique style that can be used to repurpose an old device or to display time on a current model.

For more personal use, the RomanDigital widget makes a distinctive addition to a device's Home screen.

RomanDigital includes features expected in an ordinary digital clock, such as:
* Choice of 12 or 24 hour format
* Optional AM/PM indicator (uniquely integrated into the time display)
* Option to keep display on when app is in the foreground
* Display in either portrait or landscape

The RomanDigital widget also includes variable background opacity that can be set from 0% to 100% by tens.

For more detailed information including a FAQ list, please see the README.md file accompanying the RomanDigital source code.
