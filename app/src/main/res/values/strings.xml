"Motivation to implement autosizing of the RomanDigital app widget text was provided by observation of the digital clock widget text autosizing in the excellent Clock app by BlackHawky (https://github.com/BlackyHawky/Clock). Being licensed under GNU GPL v3.0 and thus incompatible with RomanDigital's Apache 2.0 license without relicensing, BlackHawky Clock code was neither copied nor reviewed in development of the RomanDigital app widget."
